 Welcome to [MIST] -- a Minimal Interactive Shell inspired by UNIX

 Immediate TODO:
   [-] Tab-finish
     [x] Files
     [ ] Module flags
     [ ] External commands (how should this be done? Most shells seem to have complex solutions)
   [ ] Globbing (implemented via command)
   [-] Plugin system
     [-] Source-based (needs improvement)
     [ ] Shared objects (C ABI)

 For a list of builtin modules, type: `commands`
